OIOIOI

SIO2 is a free platform for carrying out algorithmic contests and OIOIOI is its
main component â€” the web interface.

Installation
------------

Docker (for deployment)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, there are available docker files to create images containing our services. We do not recommend this method of running OIOIOI. Please inspect Docker files and startup scripts before using in production.

To run the infrastructure simply::

  "OIOIOI_CONFIGDIR=<config directory>" "OIOIOI_VERSION=<oioioi_version>" docker-compose up

Make sure to change default superuser password. To do that:
   1. Login to the superuser with default credentials (username:admin, password:admin)
   2. Click username ("admin") in upper-right corner of the webpage.
   3. Click "Change password"
   4. Fill and submit password change form

To start additional number of workers::

  "OIOIOI_CONFIGDIR=<config directory>" "OIOIOI_VERSION=<oioioi_version>" docker-compose up --scale worker=<number>

as described `in Docker docs`_.

For developers
--------------

Documentation for developers:

* `Developer's Guide`_
* `Developer's Reference`_

.. _Developer's Reference: http://oioioi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Testing
-------

OIOIOI has a big suite of unit tests. You can run them in following way:

* ``test.sh`` - a simple test runner, use from virtualenv
* ``test_selenium.sh`` - long selenium tests, use from virtualenv
* ``tox [path/to/module[::TestClass[::test_method]]] [-- arg1 arg2 ...]`` - runs pytest in isolated environemnt

Supported args:

* ``-n NUM`` - run tests using NUM CPUs
* ``-v`` - increase verbosity
* ``-q`` - decrease verbosity
* ``-x`` - exit after first failure
* ``-lf`` - runs only tests that failed last time
* ``--runslow`` - runs also tests marked as slow

Usage
-----

Well, we don't have a full-fledged User's Guide, but feel free to propose
what should be added here.

Creating task packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a contest, you obviously need some tasks. To add a task to a contest in
OIOIOI, you need to create an archive, called task package. Here are some
pointers, how it should look like:

* `tutorial`_,
* `example task packages`_ used by our tests,
* `a rudimentary task package format specification`_.
