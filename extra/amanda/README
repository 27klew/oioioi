Amanda uses client-server architecture - the server is doing
backup of all registered clients. Backup strategy is defined
in server's config files ("server_config" directory). These
files contain lines, that should be added to corresponding,
existing Amanda config files (/etc/amanda/<CONFIG_DIR> on
default Ubuntu install). Client's Amanda config files are
in "client_config" directory - these describe authorization
details and contain hostname of Amanda server.

In this sample configuration, SSH was configured as described here:

And PostgreSQL was configured as described here:
