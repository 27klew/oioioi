/*
 This is grid from bootstrap v3.3.6.

 The one from version 2, which is used by oioioi was not flexible enough
 for simpleui.

 This file can be replaced by import from bootstrap 3 when we upgrade to it.
 You can treat it like standalone less grid framework.

 To use it use less mixins documented here:
 http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-less

 For example usage see contest.less

// Clearfix
//
// For modern browsers
// 1. The space content is one way to avoid an Opera bug when the
//    contenteditable attribute is included anywhere else in the document.
//    Otherwise it causes space to appear at the top and bottom of elements
//    that are clearfixed.
// 2. The use of `table` rather than `block` is only necessary if using
//    `:before` to contain the top-margins of child elements.

.clearfix() {
  &:before,
  &:after {
    content: " "; // 1
    display: table; // 2
  }
  &:after {
    clear: both;
  }
}
