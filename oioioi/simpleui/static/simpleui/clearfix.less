/*
 This is grid from bootstrap v3.3.6.

 The one from version 2, which is used by oioioi was not flexible enough
 for simpleui.

 This file can be replaced by import from bootstrap 3 when we upgrade to it.
 You can treat it like standalone less grid framework.

 To use it use less mixins documented here:
 http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-less

 For example usage see contest.less
